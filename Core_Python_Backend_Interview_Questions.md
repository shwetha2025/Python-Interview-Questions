# 1. Explain API endpoint and its role in backend.
An API endpoint is a URL that acts as an entry point for clients to access a particular service or functionality on the server. Clients interact with the backend service through these endpoints using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
# 2. What are Python decorators and how are they useful?
Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of another function or method. They are used for logging, access control, memoization, and more without changing the original functionâ€™s code.
# 3. How do you handle database connections in backend applications?
Use connection pooling to manage database connections efficiently. Ensure proper transaction handling, rollback on errors, and cleanup to avoid resource leaks. Use ORMs or query builders to abstract SQL.
